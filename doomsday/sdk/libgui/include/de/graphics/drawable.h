/**
 * Drawable object with buffers, programs and states.
 *
 * This is the higher level, flexible, user-friendly combination of the lower
 * level GL classes. It is not mandatory to use this class for drawing; one can
 * always use the lower level classes directly.
 *
 * Drawable combines a set of GLBuffer instances with a set of GL programs and
 * GL states. There can be multiple (named) instances of buffers, programs, and
 * states in a Drawable. While each buffer must have a program, having a state
 * is optional. Each buffer can choose which of the Drawable's programs and
 * states is used with the buffer. It is also possible to assign external
 * programs and states for use with buffers. A default program (with id 0) is
 * always present in a Drawable.
 *
 * Example use cases:
 * - draw a single buffer with a program using the current GL state
 * - draw a single buffer with one of many alternative programs
 * - draw multiple buffers with the same program
 * - draw some buffers with a custom GL state and the rest with the
 *   current state
 * - draw a mixture of multiple buffers and programs, each with a
 *   custom state (e.g., a set of 3D sub-models representing an object
 *   in the game)
 *
 * The buffers are drawn in the order of ascending identifiers. If no state has
 * been defined for a buffer, the topmost state on the GL state stack is used
 * for drawing that particular buffer.
 *
 * GLUniform instances can be used externally to this class to manipulate the
 * uniforms in the programs. The user is expected to provide the static/dynamic
 * vertex data for the buffers.
 *
 * Drawable is an AssetGroup: it cannot be drawn until all the contained
 * buffers and programs are ready. It is allowed to insert further assets into
 * the group if they should be present before drawing is allowed (e.g.,
 * textures).
 *
 * @ingroup gl
