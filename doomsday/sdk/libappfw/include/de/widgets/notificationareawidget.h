 * Notification area.
 *
 * Notification widgets are expected to size themselves and allow unrestricted,
 * automatical positioning inside the area. Notifications can be added and removed
 * dynamically. The notification area is dismissed if there are no visible notifications.
 *
 * Notification widgets should not be part of the normal widget tree (no add/remove
 * called). Internally, NotificationAreaWidget uses RelayWidget to link the notifications
 * to the widget tree.
 *
 * The client window owns an instance of NotificationAreaWidget. Other widgets and
 * subsystems are expected to retain ownership of their notifications, and delete them
 * when the widget/subsystem is destroyed/shut down.
 *
 * Owners of notifications can use the UniqueWidgePtr template to automatically
 * delete their notification widgets.
