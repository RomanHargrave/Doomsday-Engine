 * Widget for displaying large amounts of text.

 * Based on ScrollAreaWidget for scrolling. Only the visible portion of the
 * source text is kept ready for drawing -- the length of the source document
 * is thus unlimited. Only vertical scrolling is supported at the moment.
 *
 * DocumentWidget can be configured to expand horizontally, or it can use a
 * certain determined fixed width (see DocumentWidget::setWidthPolicy()).
 *
 * By default, the height of the widget is determined by its content size.
 *
 * The assumption is that the source document is largely static so that once
 * prepared, the GL resources can be reused as many times as possible.
