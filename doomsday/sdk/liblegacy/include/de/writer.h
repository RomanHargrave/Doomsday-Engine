/**
 * @file de/writer.h
 * Serializer for writing values and data into a byte array.
 *
 * @ingroup base
 *
 * Writer instances ensure that all values written into the array are stored in
 * little-endian (Intel) byte order. All write operations are also checked
 * against the buffer boundaries; writing too much data into the buffer results
 * in an error.
 *
 * If @c DENG_WRITER_TYPECHECK is defined, all written data is preceded by a type
 * check code, which is checked when the values are read by Reader. This
 * guarantees that data is interpreted as written.
 *
 * @see reader.h, Reader
 *
 * @todo  This should be converted into a C wrapper for de::Writer.
