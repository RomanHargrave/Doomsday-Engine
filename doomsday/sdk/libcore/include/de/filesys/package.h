 * A @em package is a collection of files packaged into a single unit (possibly using an
 * Archive). Examples of packages are add-on packages (in various formats, e.g., PK3/ZIP
 * archive or the Snowberry add-on bundle), savegames, custom maps, and demos.
 *
 * An instance of Package represents a package that is currently loaded. Note that
 * the package's metadata namespace is owned by the file that contains the package;
 * Package only consists of state that is relevant while the package is loaded (i.e.,
 * in active use).
