 * - Immediately after connecting to a server the socket is put into the
 *   set of remote users (RemoteUser class). One RemoteUser instance is
 *   responsible for each connected socket.
 * - Remote users may request upgrade to a Shell user, in which case ownership
 *   of the socket is given to a ShellUser instance.
 * - Remote users may join the game, becoming players in the game.
 * - Silent remote users that hang around too long will be automatically
 *   terminated if haven't joined the game.
 *
 * @todo This is a work in progress, as all remnants of the old network code
 * have not been removed/revised.
