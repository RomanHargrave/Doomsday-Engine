 * API" under the "FMOD Ex Programmer's API" license (or modified versions of
 * such code, with unchanged license). You may copy and distribute such a

 * the other code concerned, provided that you include the source code of that
 * other code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.
 * (Note that people who make modified versions of audio_fmod are not obligated
 * to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their
