/**
 * @file busymode.h
 * Busy Mode @ingroup core
 *
 * The Busy Mode is intended for long-running tasks that would otherwise block
 * the main engine (UI) thread. During busy mode, a progress screen is shown by
 * the main thread while a background thread works on a long operation. The
 * normal Doomsday UI cannot be interacted with while the task is running. The
 * busy mode can be configured to show a progress bar, the console output,
 * and/or a description of the task being carried out.
 *
 * @todo Refactor: Remove the busy mode loop to prevent the app UI from
 * freezing while busy mode is running. Instead, busy mode should run in the
 * regular application event loop. During busy mode, the game loop callback
 * should not be called.
