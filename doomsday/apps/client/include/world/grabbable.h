/**
 * Abstract base for any class whose instances can be manipulated and/or moved
 * by proxy once "grabbed". Conceptually a grabbable is similar to a reference
 * counter combined with an API which imposes additional restrictions to the
 * behavior/semantics of interactions with the derived instance(s).
 *
 * All grabbables have a map coordinate space origin. Each instance may be put
 * into a "locked" state where this origin is considered immutable. It should
 * be noted that this lock is a @em logical concept which is only enforced by
 * this interface (it may still be moved by some other means provided either
 * the OriginChange audience is notified, or the old origin is respected).
