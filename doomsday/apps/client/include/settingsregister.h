/**
 * Collection of settings (cvars, Config variables) of which there can be
 * several alternative profiles. When a register is created, it automatically
 * gets a profile called "User".
 *
 * The default values are stored separately, so that any profile can be reseted
 * back to the default values.
 *
 * All settings of a register should be defined before it gets used.
 *
 * The current profile is simply whatever values the identified cvars/variables
 * presently hold. These current values get stored persistently in the app's
 * Config (and via con_config) as usual. SettingsRegister is responsible for
 * storing the non-current profiles persistently. The (de)serialization occurs
 * whenever the game is (un)loaded, as all cvars are presently game-specific.
 *
 * It is possible to install new profiles via resource packs. The profiles should
 * be placed to /data/profiles/(persistentName)/.
