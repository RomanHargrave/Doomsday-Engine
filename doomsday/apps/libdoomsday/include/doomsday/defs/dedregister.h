/**
 * General purpose register of DED definitions.
 *
 * The important characteristics of definitions are:
 * - preserving the order in which the definitions were parsed
 * - definitions are looked up by ID, name, and/or other members in addition to the
 *   ordinal number (lookup is text-based)
 *
 * DEDRegister is not specific to any one kind of definition, but instead maintains an
 * array of definitions and a set of lookup dictionaries referencing subrecords in the
 * ordered array.
 *
 * This implementation assumes that definitions are only added, not removed (unless
 * all of them are removed at once).
