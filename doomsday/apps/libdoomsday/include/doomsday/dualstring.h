/**

 * with a full de::String. The secondary Str is only updated on demand, when
 * someone needs access to the C-style string (or Str). There are no guarantees
 * that a previously returned pointer to the Str contents remains valid or is
 * up to date after making changes to the de::String side.
 *
 * The only allowed situation where the string is modified via the Str side is
 * when one calls DualString::toStr() and then DualString::update() after the
 * changes have been done via Str.

 * This class should only be used to support legacy code.
